# Facial Recognition for Co-founders
We curated a list of co-founders of big tech giants and thought how we could indirectly make them more recognized as we believe that poeple are aware of the faces that on the camera and not behind them. So, this project basically recongnises your face and tries to match it with the co-founders in our list. 
This not only makes the user inquisitive about who that person they were matched to was but also brings the co-founders into the limelight.
## Expansion
We plan to add more people from startups and different kinds of companies which are not restricted to tech.
## Built With
* Python
* Open CV
